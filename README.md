<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Employees may become less productive the longer they stay at the same company, due to many underlying factors. 
This project builds a neural network model to predict employee attrition and then see if concessions given would reduce or eliminate attrition. 
Ultimately, this can be used to see if an employee should be given extra concessions or replaced.
